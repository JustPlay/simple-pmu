simple-pmu
----------

This is a simple Intel PMU driver that allows to read fixed counters
from user space.
    
Useful to measure cycles without worrying about Turbo mode and p-states.
Essentially this is a replacement for RDTSC for performance analysis.
    
It doesn't attempt to compete with any of the big PMU guys like
perf or oprofile.
   
Usage
-----

make KSRC=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
(or make KSRC=/your/kernel/source or objdir)

su
make modules_install
